# Article Popularity Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains the code and report for a machine learning project on predicting online news article popularity (measured via shares).  
We evaluate whether unconventional composite indices (originality and effort) add predictive power, and compare them against standard structural, topical, timing, and sentiment-based features.

## What’s inside
- **Report (PDF):** full methodology, experiments, results, and discussion
- **Code (notebook):** preprocessing, feature engineering (originality/effort), feature selection (LASSO/RFECV/MI), model training (LogReg/RF/MLP), and clustering (K-means)

## How to use
Open the notebook and run cells top-to-bottom to reproduce the analysis.  
Refer to the PDF report for detailed explanations and interpretation.

## Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, matplotlib
